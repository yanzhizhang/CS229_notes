<h2>
<span style="font-family: Times;">Course Description<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<big>This course provides a broad introduction to
machine learning and statistical pattern recognition.  Topics include:
supervised learning (generative/discriminative learning,
parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, support vector
machines); unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction,
kernel methods); learning theory (bias/variance tradeoffs; VC theory;
large margins); reinforcement learning and adaptive control.
The course will also discuss recent applications of machine learning,
such as to robotic control, data mining, autonomous navigation,
bioinformatics, speech recognition, and text and web data
processing. </big></p><br>

<h2><span style="font-family: Times;">Prerequisites<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
   <big>Students are expected to have the following background:</big>

<ul type="disc">
     <big>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="">Knowledge of basic
 computer science principles and skills,
<!-- (such as big-O notation, queues, stacks, graphs, etc.), !-->
at a level sufficient to write a reasonably non-trivial computer program.
 </li>
<!--Ability
 to understand      and analyze fairly complicated algorithms and data structures.
 The course      will assume familiarity with such concepts as: big-O notation,
 queues and      stacks, graphs, etc. !-->
</li>
       <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Familiarity
 with the basic probability theory. (CS109 or Stat116 is sufficient but not
    necessary.) </li>
     <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Familiarity with the basic linear
algebra (any one of Math 51, Math 103, Math 113, or CS 205 would be much more than
necessary.)</li>
</big>
</ul>
<!--<big>CS221 is <em>not</em> a prerequisite for this course.</big>!-->

<h2><span style="font-family: Times;">Homeworks and Grading</span></h2>

<big>
There will be four written <b>homeworks</b>,
one <b>midterm,</b> and one major open-ended <b>term project</b>. The homeworks will
contain written questions and questions that require some Matlab programming.
In the term project, you will investigate some interesting aspect of machine
learning or apply machine learning to a problem that interests you. </p>

We try very hard to make questions unambiguous, but some ambiguities
may remain. Ask if confused or state your assumptions explicitly. Reasonable
assumptions will be accepted in case of ambiguous questions.</p>

<p>
<b>Honor code:</b> 
We strongly encourage students to form
study groups.  Students may discuss and work on homework problems in groups.
However, each student must write down the solutions independently, and without
referring to written notes from the joint session.  In other words, each
student must understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct
it by him/herself. In addition, each student should write on the problem
set the set of people with whom s/he collaborated. </p>

Further, since we occasionally reuse problem set questions from
previous years, we expect students not to copy, refer to, or look
at the solutions in preparing their answers.  It is an <b>honor code
violation to intentionally refer to a previous year's solutions</b>.
This applies both to the official solutions and to solutions that
you or someone else may have written up in a previous year.
</p>

<p>
<b>Late assignments:</b> 
Each student will have a total of <b>seven
free late (calendar) days</b> to use for
homeworks, project proposals and project milestones.

Once these late days are exhausted, any assignments turned in late will be
penalized 20% per late day.  However, <b>no assignment will be accepted
more than four days after its due date</b>, and late days cannot be used
for the final project writeup.  Each 24 hours or part thereof that a
homework is late uses up one full late day.
</p>

<p>
<b>Assignment submission:</b> 
To hand in an assignment,
write down the date and time of submission, and leave it in the submission
box near/outside Gates 188 and 182.  Please don't disturb the staff in
those offices; directions to the hand-in box are
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs229/submissionbox/tour.html">here</a>.
<!--To get into the basement after the building is locked, slide your SUID card
in the card reader by the main basement entrance.) !-->
It is an honor code violation to write down the wrong time.
</p>

Regular (non-SCPD) students should submit hardcopies of all four written homeworks.
Please do not email your homework solutions to us.
</p>
<!--
<p>
SCPD students: Please submit your assignments at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/class/cs229/cgi-bin/submit.php">https://www.stanford.edu/class/cs229/cgi-bin/submit.php</a> as a single PDF file under 20MB in size.  If you have trouble submitting online, you can also email your submission to cs229-qa@cs.stanford.edu. However, we strongly recommend using the website submission method as it will provide confirmation of submission, and also allow us to track and return your graded homework to you more easily.
    If you are scanning your document by cellphone, please check the Piazza forum (<a href="piazza.com/stanford/fall2015/cs229/home">piazza.com/stanford/fall2015/cs229/home</a>) for recommended cellphone scanning apps and best practices.
</p>

<p>
SCPD students: there is an update on homework submission procedures for SCPD students. Please follow these updated procedures to ensure your homework be properly collected, graded and returned.
<br>
If you are submitting your homework on-time without using any late-days, please submit your homework through the SCPD office. 
(Fax: 650-736-1266. Email: <a href="mailto:scpd-distribution@lists.stanford.edu" target="_top">scpd-distribution@lists.stanford.edu</a>). 
Please do not forget to attach the 
<a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials/coverSheet.pdf" target="_blank">Cover Sheet</a> (for CS 229 Only) 
and 
<a href="http://scpdweb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/scpd_homeworkrouteform.pdf" target="_blank">SCPD Homework Route Form</a> (Required by SCPD). 
Detailed instructions and university SCPD homework policies can be found 
<a href="http://scpd.stanford.edu/programs/courses/graduate-courses/homework" target="_blank">here</a>. 
<br>
If you are submitting your homework late using any late-days, please submit your homework through the email submission system at 
<a href="https://www.stanford.edu/class/cs229/cgi-bin/submit.php" target="_blank">https://www.stanford.edu/class/cs229/cgi-bin/submit.php</a>. 
Please also attach the Cover Sheet and SCPD Homework Route Form to ensure a prompt return.
</p>

The term project may be done in teams of up to three persons.
The midterm is open-book/open-notes, and will cover the material of
the first part of the course.  It will take place on November 4,  6-9pm (location TBD).

</p>

<!--
<p><b>Course grades:</b> 
will be based 40% on homeworks (10% each),
20% on the midterm, and 40% on the major term project. Up to 2% extra
credit may be awarded for class participation, such as for helping
classmates on the 
<a href="http://piazza.com/stanford/fall2014/cs229">Piazza forum</a>.
</p>
</big>
<br>

<h2><span style="font-family: Times;">Sections<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<big>
To review material from the prerequisites or to supplement the lecture
material, there will occasionally be extra discussion sections held on
Friday.  An announcement will be made whenever one of these sections is
held. Attendance at these sections is optional.
</p>
</big>
<br>

<h2><span style="font-family: Times;">Communication with the Teaching Staff<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<big>
<p>
If you have a question that is not confidential or personal, encourage
you to post it on our <a href="http://piazza.com/stanford/fall2015/cs229">forum on Piazza</a>.
To contact the teaching staff directly, we strongly encourage you to come to office hours.
If that is not possible, you can also email us at the course staff list,
<a href="mailto:cs229-qa@cs.stanford.edu">cs229-qa@cs.stanford.edu</a> (consisting
of the TAs and the professor). By having questions sent to all of us,
you will get answers much more quickly.  Of course, confidential or personal questions
can still be sent directly to Professor Ng or the TAs. 

<p>For grading questions, please talk to us after class or during office
hours.  If you want a regrade, write an explanation and drop the homework
and the explanation into the
<a href=http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs229/submissionbox/tour.html>
submission box</a> near Gates 182/188.
</p>

<p><span style="">Answers to commonly asked questions and clarifications
to the homeworks will be posted on the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs229/faq.html">FAQ</a>.
<!--It is each student's responsibility to check the FAQ on a regular basis. Major changes
(e.g., bugs in the homework) will also be posted to the class mailing list. --> </p>
